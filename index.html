    <h2>SKILLS</h2>
    <p><strong>Analytical Tools :</strong> Power BI, Tableau, Excel.</p>
    <p><strong>Programming Languages:</strong>SQL, Python, Html, Css, and partially Java.</p>
    <p><strong>IDE'S & Tools:</strong>Visual studio code, my SQl Workbench, google colab</p>
    <p><strong>Database :</strong> MY SQl.</p>
    <p><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> <pre>Analytical Thinking, Efffective Communication, Problem Solving, Time Management   </pre></p>        
    <h2>Data Analytics Training at FixityEdx</h2>                                                  
    <pre>                                                                                  April 2024-Nov 2024</pre>
    <ul><li>Created datasets and collected data from various sources for the project reuirement. </li>
    <li>Used Power Query to import and clean data based on project requirements.  </li>
    <li>Created reports and dashboards in Power BI to gain insights from the data, which were used for decision-making.</li>
    <li>Used MySQL to extract data from different tables in the database as per our requirements .</li></ul>
    <h2>ACADEMIC PROJECT</h2>
    <B>Agriculture crop recommendation based on productivity and seasons using Machine learning.</B> 
    <ul><li>The system will predict the most suitable crop for particular land based on soil contents and weather parameters 
        such as Temperature, Humidity, soil PH and Rainfall. Hence by utilizing our system farmers can cultivate a new 
        variety of crop, may increase in profit margin. </li>
    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Data collection is the most efficient method for collecting and measure the data from different 
        resources like govt websites, VC Form Mandya, APMC website etc. This dataset must contain the following 
        attributes (i) Soil PH (ii) Temperature (iii) Humidity (iv) Rainfal (v) Crop data (vi) NPK values. </li>
    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> After collecting datasets from various resources. Dataset must be preprocessing before 
        training to the model. After data cleaning the dataset will be split into training and test set by using sklearn 
        library. The dataset has 3,000 rows of data to train the model.  </li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning Algorithm for Prediction:</strong> Machine learning predictive algorithms has highly optimized 
        estimation has to be likely outcome based on trained data.  </li>
    <li>In our system we used supervised machine learning algorithm having subcategories as classification and 
        regression. Classification algorithm will be most suitable for our system <br class="crop">
        <n>➢ Crop prediction: Decision tree algorithm with accuracy is 80.9%.so this algorithm is suitable for this        
            project.</n>    
          
        </li>
    <li><strong>Crop Recommendation:</strong> Based on  rainfall, soil contents and weather parameters the system will recommend 
        the most suitable crop for cultivation. </li></ul>
<h2>DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT </h2>
<ol><li><strong>Adventure works product Analysis: </strong></li><b>Description:</b> Developed a dashboard and created interactive visualizations that enable users to drill down into specific 
    metrics, such as sales by region, product category with respective year wise, customer segmentation and time period <br class="responsibilities"> Responsibilities:<ul><li>Loaded the data in powerbi and transformed it, to clean the data used by power query in powerbi.</li>
        <li>Next followed by data modelling to build the relation between the tables. </li>
        <li>To build the relation between the tables used star schema in data modelling.</li>
        <li>In the table view created some measures to get the key performance indicators (KPI’s). </li>
        <li>To generate reports based on sales performance, customer segmentation, product performance.</li></ul>
    <li><strong>Sales Analysis Dashboard Development: </strong><b>Description:</b> Description: Developed a Power BI dashboard for sales analysis using Excel data. Created data models, visualizations, 
        and an interactive dashboard.  <br class="responsibilities"> Responsibilities:<ul><li>Loaded and transformed data from Excel. Defined relationships and calculated columns. </li>
            <li>Designed visualizations (line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc.). Built interactive dashboards with slicers and      
                filters.   </li>
            <li>Generated actionable sales insights.</li>
            <li><b>Skills: </b>Power BI, Data Analysis, Visualization, Excel Integration, Dashboard development.  </li>
            <li><b>Outcome:</b>Improved decision-making with comprehensive sales analysis and actionable recommendations.</li></ul</li>
